Game of life specs:

Rules:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. 

| Rule | status | neighbors | action |
|    1 | True   | <2        | False  |
|    2 | True   | 2,3       | True   |
|    3 | True   | 3<        | False  |
|    4 | False  | 3         | True   | 


A. Checks how many neighbors are there.
B. Apply rule and change status of all cell at same time.
C. Go back to step A


  
Neighbours:
| i-1, j-1 | i-1, j | i-1, j+1 |
| i  , j-1 | i  , j | i  , j+1 |
| i+1, j-1 | i+1, j | i+1, j+1 |

existential check:
Given i and j, neighbour shouldn't have negative index or index greater than size of matrix
